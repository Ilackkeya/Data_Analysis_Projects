# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Analysis

### Introduction
Heart attacks, or myocardial infarctions, continue to be a significant global health issue, necessitating a deeper comprehension of their precursors and potential mitigating factors. By employing predictive analytics on the patient's dataset encapsulating a wide range of attributes including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, exercise patterns, dietary preferences, and more, can be used to elucidate the complex interplay of these variables in determining the likelihood of a heart attack which can further help researchers and healthcare professionals to work towards proactive strategies for heart disease prevention and management.

#### Description of the Dataset
The synthetic dataset provides a comprehensive array of features relevant to heart health and lifestyle choices, encompassing patient-specific details such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and indicators like diabetes, family history, smoking habits, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, lifestyle factors like exercise hours, dietary habits, stress levels, and sedentary hours are included. Medical aspects comprising previous heart problems, medication usage, and triglyceride levels are considered. Socioeconomic aspects such as income and geographical attributes like country, continent, and hemisphere are incorporated. The dataset, consisting of 8763 records from patients around the globe, culminates in a crucial binary classification feature denoting the presence or absence of a heart attack risk, providing a comprehensive resource for predictive analysis and research in cardiovascular health.
